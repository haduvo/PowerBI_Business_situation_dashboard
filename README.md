In general, the growth amplitude over time is quite uniform, low in the first quarter and gradually increasing until the fourth quarter. Some regions with erratic growth amplitudes such as Canada have very high revenue and profits in the second quarter of the year 2012 is $8,085.75 and $2,724.21. But then both revenue and profit gradually decreased until the end of the second quarter of 2013, reaching $2,311.56 and $536.22. However, immediately after that, in the third quarter of 2013, revenue and profit skyrocketed to $7,491.51 and $2,48.37. Similarly, the EMEA region also had a towering profit in the second quarter of 2013 of $6,582.83 but plummeted to -$3,349.04 in the 3rd quarter of 2013 but the revenue from the 2nd quarter to the 3rd quarter still increased from $54,118.61 to $58,81.63. The LATAM region also has a very large fluctuation range in revenue and profit between adjacent quarters in the same year. Although for the whole year of 2012, revenue increased gradually from quarter 1 to quarter 4 from $41,430.26 to $161,076.92, quarter 1 profit of $3,127.66 increased nearly 3 times to $11,911.24 in quarter 2 but in quarter 3 it decreased to only $9,342.23 and in the fourth quarter it again skyrocketed to $18,363.66.

The Technology industry has a relatively stable revenue and profit growth cycle, lowest in the first quarter and gradually increasing to the highest in the fourth quarter of every year. However, in 2013, although revenue still grew normally from the first quarter of $171,531.84 to the 4th quarter of $382,241.72, the first quarter's profit of $25,599.38 soared to nearly 2 times, at $49,907.7 in the 2nd quarter and then again decreased to $33,983.59 in the 3rd quarter and skyrocketed to $55,492.83 in the 4th quarter. The Office Supplies industry had steady low revenue and profit growth in the 1st quarter and gradually increased to the highest in the 4th quarter over years and industries. Furniture is similar, but the amplitude of revenue fluctuations over the quarters of the Furniture industry is higher than that of the Office Supplies industry. In the Technology industry, Copiers bring the highest profit of $234,600 and the lowest profit is Machines with $55,490. In the Office Supplies industry, the highest profit is $113,230 from Storage and the lowest is Labels with $7,610. In the Furniture industry, Chairs has the highest profit of $152,380 and the lowest profit is Furnishings with $37,770.

## Recommendations:
Most of the important customers bring large profit come from the US and EU markets although the highest profit rate comes from APAC. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to building many incentives and gratitude programs to retain customers in these markets and pay attention to expanding and developing the US market. Although the US market has a profit rate of 19.5% higher than the LATAM market, which is 15.21%, the shipping cost of the LATAM market is $217,540, almost equal to the US market's $218,500. So it is necessary to consider improving shipping costs in the LATAM market. Along with that, the LATAM market is the market with the highest number of returned 825, so attention needs to be paid to improvement. The Technology industry is the most profitable and the Copiers and Phones products of this industry are also the most profitable products, so it is necessary to build reputation and ensure quality as well as continuously improve new technology to maintain and develop these key products. The Tables industry brings negative profits in the long run, so we need to pay attention to cutting back so as not to affect business performance. The Office Supplies industry is the industry with the most returned orders, twice as many as Furniture and Technology with products from Binders, Storge, and Paper, so it is necessary to pay attention to checking and improving the quality of products in order to protect the reputation of the business.
